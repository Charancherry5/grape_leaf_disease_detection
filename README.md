### Grape Leaf Disease Detection and Pesticide Recommendation using Deep Learning
**Deep Learning (Python Programming, TensorFlow, Keras) | Self Project**
- Developed a comprehensive system for detecting grape leaf diseases and recommending appropriate pesticides using deep learning techniques.
- Employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate image classification of grape leaf diseases, achieving high precision and recall metrics.
- Implemented advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset, ensuring robust model performance.
- Integrated a recommendation engine that suggests effective pesticides based on the detected disease, leveraging a curated database of pesticide information.
- Conducted extensive model evaluation and tuning to optimize performance, including hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation.
- Built an streamlit appliction for front-end and used trained model for backend.
- Demonstrated the systemâ€™s practical utility by providing real-time disease detection and actionable pesticide recommendations, aiding in efficient disease management.
